Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for perfectionism. However, the existing significant barriers to access and utilization of mental health services, including among college students, demand the development of low-intensity accessible interventions. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a low-intensity CBT-based self-help gamified app developed specifically for perfectionism in a sample of college students.\n\nMethods\n\nParticipants completed assessments of perfectionism, related symptoms, emotional burden and functional impairments at pretreatment, posttreatment and at one-month follow-up.\n\nResults\n\nCompared with the waitlist condition (n = 35), the app condition (n = 35) demonstrated a significant and greater reduction in perfectionism, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, functional impairments and subjective ratings of emotional burden.\n\nConclusions\n\nResults suggest that a brief, daily app-based game-like intervention targeting maladaptive perfectionistic beliefs may be a viable, low-cost alternative to traditional CBT treatments for vulnerable populations on college campuses."

This study investigates the efficacy of a mHealth app in reducing body dissatisfaction, BDD/ED symptoms and related features.\n\nMethod: Ninety-five Italian women who were high-risk of developing BIDs were randomized into immediate-use of the App (iApp group) and delayed-use of the App (dApp group). The iApp group started using the app at baseline for 16 days while the dApp group started using the app from day 16 to day 32. Participants completed questionnaires at baseline, 16 days from baseline, and 32 days from baseline.\n\nResults: Compared to the dApp, the iApp group demonstrated a greater decrease in BDD symptoms and body dissatisfaction at the 16 day mark.

Recent research suggests mental health apps are promising tools for coping with OCD symptoms. This randomized controlled trial evaluated the effects of a CBT-based mobile application designed to reduce OCD symptoms and cognitions in community participants considered at high risk of developing OCD symptoms.\n\nMethod: Participants were recruited through university mailing lists and social media. 55 participants were randomly assigned to the iApp (n = 28) and dApp (n = 27) groups. The iApp group started using GG OCD for 12 consecutive days. The participants in the dApp group were asked to start using GG OCD after the iApp group completed GG OCD and use it for 12 consecutive days. Both groups completed self-report questionnaires in the beginning, at the 12 day mark and at the end.\n\nResults: The short, daily cognitive exercises on GG OCD were associated with improved OCD symptom and cognition measures and these effects persisted at follow-up. Interaction effects revealed significantly fewer OCD symptoms, obsessive beliefs, and intolerance of uncertainty immediately after the 12 day mark assessment in the iApp group compared to the dApp group. These results were maintained at follow-up. Furthermore, once participants in the dApp group started using GG OCD (following crossover), they reported similar large effect-size reductions in their OCD symptoms and cognitions. Thus, the effects found in iApp group were replicated in the dApp group.\n\nConclusion: Our findings suggest that even a brief, daily cognitive intervention without behavioral elements may lead to a significant reduction in OCD symptoms and cognitions during times of uncertainty, increased stress, and anxiety.\n\nCite: Akin-Sari, B., Inozu, M., Haciomeroglu, A.

Cognitive behavioral models of OCD propose obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms result from catastrophic misinterpretations of commonly occurring intrusive experiences and associated dysfunctional strategies used to manage them. OCD-related maladaptive beliefs including inflated responsibility, importance and control of thoughts, perfectionism, and intolerance for uncertainty increase the likelihood of such misinterpretations.\n\nObjective: Consistent with accumulating evidence suggesting mobile health (mHealth) apps based on cognitive-behavioral principles may lead to significant reductions in psychopathological symptoms, we assessed the effectiveness of a novel cognitive training app (GGRO) designed to challenge OCD-related beliefs.\n\nMethods: Ninety-seven students were randomized to immediate use (iApp) or delayed use (dApp) groups of GGRO. All participants were requested to complete a web-based assessment, with questionnaires relating to maladaptive beliefs, mood, and OC symptoms at baseline (T1), 15 days following baseline (T2) and 30 days following baseline (T3). Participants in iApp group started using the app at baseline and continued using the app for 15 consecutive days. They were then requested to stop using the app until T3. Participants in the dApp group were requested to wait for 15 days and only then start using the app (cross-over) for 15 consecutive days.\n\nResults: All participants used the app for a mean 14.07 (SD=1.41) days with a 2.94 levels per day. Replicating previous findings, app use was associated with medium-large effect size reductions in both groups iApp (n=51) and dApp (n=46). In the iApp group, all effects remained significant during 15 days follow-up. Analyses focusing on the first two assessment occasions revealed significant Treatment × Repeated Measures interactions for maladaptive beliefs, several OC symptom measures, and self-esteem. \n\nConclusions: This study provides further evidence for the efficacy of GGRO as a mobile-delivered training exercise, useful for the reduction of OCD-related beliefs and symptoms.\n\nTrial registration: ClinicalTrial.gov ID NCT03571464.\n\nCite: Roncero, M., Belloch, A., & Doron, G.

GGOC is a mobile app designed to challenge maladaptive beliefs in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). This single-case study assesses the usefulness of GGOC as a relapse prevention tool for individuals with OCD.\n\nMethod: The patient was a 26-year-old female with severe contamination and washing/cleaning OCD symptoms (Y-BOCS=33) and co-morbid Major Depression. GGOC was used for relapse prevention (daily/2weeks) following 32 weekly/sessions of individual CBT (Y-BOCS at the end of CBT and before GGOC=7). Patient completed 47 levels dedicated to OCD-relevant maladaptive beliefs. Before and after GGOC, the Y-BOCS, Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory (OCI-R), Obsessive Beliefs Questionnaire (OBQ-20), and DASS-20 Depression were completed.\n\nResults: The OBQ-20 and OCI-R scores decreased from pre- to post-GGOC. The Y-BOCS score decreased from 7 pre-GGOC to 2 post-GGOC.\n\nConclusions: Findings support the efficacy of GGOC as a relapse prevention tool for individuals with OCD which contributes to maintaining gains after CBT.\n\nCite: Pascual-Vera, B., Roncero, M., Doron, G., & Belloch, A.

        "fullText": "Background and objectives: According to cognitive models, obsessive compulsive symptoms result from catastrophic misinterpretations of commonly occurring intrusive experiences and the use of counterproductive strategies to manage them. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) related beliefs such as inflated responsibility, importance of thoughts and perfectionism increases the likelihood of such misinterpretations. Consistent with a growing body of literature supporting the usefulness of mobile delivered technologies in fostering cognitive behavior change, the present study assessed the effectiveness of a novel cognitive training exercise designed to challenge OCD-related beliefs. This mobile app training exercise consists of users having to pull statements challenging OCD beliefs towards themselves (downwards) and to throw away (push upwards) contra-productive self-statements. \n\nMethods: 36 third-year BA students started the trial. Twenty completed pre and post measures of OCD-beliefs, mood and OCD symptoms including relationship-obsessions. Participants were instructed to complete 3 min of daily training for a period of 15 days. \n\nResults: No significant differences were found between completers and non-completers on demographic and most symptom related measures at Time 1. Repeated-measures MANOVA of the 20 completers showed a significant reduction on all OCD symptoms measures and on OCD-beliefs. No significant reduction was found in depression symptoms. Regression analysis showed change in levels of OCD-beliefs was associated with reduction in OCD symptoms at Time 2 over and above OCD symptoms at Time 1. \n\nLimitations: The study is an open trial with non-clinical participants. Conclusions: This mobile delivered training exercise may be useful for the reduction and relapse prevention of OCD-related beliefs and symptoms.\n\nCite: Roncero, M., Belloch, A., & Doron, G. (2018).
